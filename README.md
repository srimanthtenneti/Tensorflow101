# Tensorflow101

### Introduction

Hello guys great to see that you have shown intrest in the Tensorflow101 webinar and in this hands on session we will be implementing an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) , a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) using Tensorflow and then look at some Machine Learning models. This would help you with your submission for the Google Solution Challenge. 

*** Note: 
This session would not cover the math behind the models and is strictly a hands on session. Though the required material , articles and references will be available in this repository. So, intrested attendees can go through them. 

### How to use this repo ?

This repo contains a template for developing an ANN and a CNN which the attendees can use to work along and implement the code. Also, for the attendees who could not follow there is a solution notebook that they can follow. 

Also, this repo contains a complete custom classifier template that the attendees can use to train CNN classifiers for their applications with minor tuning. The custom classifier template would also save the model so that the model can be integrated to another application. 

Finally we have a template for 2 powerful machine learning models that can be used to train a regression or a classification model. This saves the model in onnx format which can be deployed in an application. 

### Conclusion

Using the code in this repo you can develop working models that can be deployed in your applications. Hope you liked the session and best of luck with your Google Solution Challenge submission. 


#### Bye :)
